## 🎯 Objective

The central question driving this project:

> **Does parameter-efficient fine-tuning actually improve the performance of a small language model on a task-specific dataset — or is the improvement assumed rather than proven?**

Rather than evaluating the fine-tuned model in isolation, this project runs a **controlled, side-by-side comparison** against the original base model on identical evaluation examples, then digs into *where* and *why* performance changed using topic-level, difficulty-level, and regression analysis.

## 🧠 Model & Fine-Tuning

| | |
|---|---|
| **Base Model** | Qwen2.5-1.5B |
| **Fine-Tuning Method** | QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) |
| **Evaluation Metric** | ROUGE-L |

QLoRA enables parameter-efficient fine-tuning by keeping the base model quantized (4-bit) while training lightweight, low-rank adapter layers on top — dramatically reducing memory and compute requirements without sacrificing the quality of task adaptation.

## 📊 Evaluation Method

The base model and the fine-tuned model were evaluated on the **exact same held-out examples**, ensuring a fair, apples-to-apples comparison. The evaluation pipeline produces:

- ✅ Baseline predictions
- ✅ Fine-tuned predictions
- ✅ ROUGE-L scores per example
- ✅ Per-example improvement deltas
- ✅ Topic-wise performance breakdown
- ✅ Difficulty-wise performance breakdown
- ✅ Regression analysis (where fine-tuning *hurt* performance)

The goal was to **prove** measurable improvement with data — not simply assume that fine-tuning helps.

---

## 📈 Results

### 1️⃣ Baseline vs Fine-Tuned Performance by Difficulty

The chart below compares ROUGE-L scores between the baseline and fine-tuned model across three difficulty tiers — **Junior**, **Senior**, and **Staff** — offering a direct view of how fine-tuning affects performance as task complexity increases.

![Baseline vs Fine-Tuned Performance by Difficulty](results/plots/performance_by_difficulty.png)

**Key takeaway:** the fine-tuned model outperforms the baseline consistently across *all* difficulty levels, with the largest relative gains appearing at the **Staff** level — suggesting fine-tuning helps most on the hardest, most nuanced examples.


## 2️⃣ Top 10 Topics Improved by Fine-Tuning

This chart ranks the topics with the **largest relative ROUGE-L improvement** after fine-tuning, highlighting exactly where the training data had the greatest impact.

![Top 10 Topics Improved by Fine-Tuning](results/plots/top_10_topics_improvement.png)

**Key takeaway:** the strongest gains cluster around **ML systems and training-engineering topics** — batch size / gradient accumulation tradeoffs, fault-tolerant training design, learning-rate scheduling, and preference-optimization pitfalls (DPO/IPO) — indicating the fine-tuning dataset was especially effective at teaching deep, applied LLM-training knowledge.

---

## 🔍 Error & Regression Analysis

Fine-tuning does not uniformly improve every example — and pretending otherwise would make for a dishonest evaluation. To keep this analysis grounded in reality, examples where the **fine-tuned model underperformed the baseline** were specifically isolated and studied.

This regression analysis:
- Surfaces cases where fine-tuning introduced *new* errors
- Helps distinguish genuine skill improvement from overfitting to certain patterns
- Provides a more realistic, trustworthy picture of what the fine-tuning process actually achieved

📁 Full evaluation and comparison files are available in the [`results/`](results/) directory.
