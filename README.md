# Qwen2.5-1.5B QLoRA Fine-Tuning & Evaluation

A practical experiment on fine-tuning **Qwen2.5-1.5B** using **QLoRA** and evaluating whether the fine-tuned model actually performs better than the original base model on a custom instruction dataset.

The project focuses not only on fine-tuning, but also on **quantitative evaluation, comparison, topic-level analysis, difficulty-level analysis, and regression analysis**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The main objective of this project was to investigate:

> **Does parameter-efficient fine-tuning improve the performance of a small language model on a task-specific dataset?**

Instead of evaluating only the fine-tuned model, the project compares it against the **original base model** using the same evaluation examples.

## 🧠 Model & Fine-Tuning

**Base Model:** Qwen2.5-1.5B

**Fine-Tuning Method:** QLoRA

QLoRA enables parameter-efficient fine-tuning by keeping the base model quantized while training lightweight adapter parameters.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Hugging Face Datasets
- PEFT
- QLoRA
- BitsAndBytes
- TRL
- ROUGE-L
- Google Colab

📊 Evaluation Method

The base model and fine-tuned model were evaluated on the same evaluation examples.

The comparison includes:

Baseline predictions
Fine-tuned predictions
ROUGE-L scores
Per-example improvement
Topic-wise performance
Difficulty-wise performance
Regression analysis

The purpose of the evaluation was to determine whether fine-tuning produced measurable improvement rather than assuming that fine-tuning automatically improves performance.


📈 Results
Performance by Difficulty

The following visualization compares the performance of the baseline model and fine-tuned model across different difficulty levels.

This provides a direct view of how fine-tuning affected model performance across different levels of task difficulty.


Top 10 Topics Improved by Fine-Tuning

The following visualization shows the topics with the largest improvement after fine-tuning.

This helps identify the areas where the fine-tuned model benefited most from the training data.


🔍 Error & Regression Analysis

Fine-tuning does not necessarily improve every individual example.

Therefore, examples where the fine-tuned model performed worse than the baseline were separately identified and analyzed.

This provides a more realistic evaluation of the fine-tuning process and helps identify cases where fine-tuning introduced regressions.

Detailed evaluation and comparison files are available in the results/ directory.
